\section{Introduction}

In this assignment, we looked at 3 different data structures that are very important for computer science. We examined
the usefulness and implementation of the heap, the priority queue, and the binary search tree. The program that we
designed to test these data structures were fairly trivial, but the challenge was implementing the assignment using the
data structures that we were supposed to implement. 

The first part of the assignment was to make a binary search tree that help users and their passwords. The binary search
tree was built using the name of the user as the node name. This allowed us to quickly search the list of users. This is
efficient when there are many users and when the program user needs to find a specific user quickly. The implementation
of the binary search tree we implemented was a template class that could handle any data structure. For this assignment,
we made our own data structure that included the name and the pass as string objects. This allowed us to do many useful
things such as compare. This was useful because it allowed the quick comparison of the string objects when building the
binary search tree. 

In the second part of the assignment, we were asked to implement an updated priority queue that allowed the users to
remove a specific item from the tree and to update the elements within the tree. This was done through inheritance. A
class called ``pqueue.h'' was defined that was a basic priority queue. The new updated queue, U\_PQType, was derived
from this class in order to include the two new functions. This derived class used the heap property of the priority
queue to implement the assignments challenge. We were asked to read in numbers from a file and place them into a heap.

\section{Use of Code}

In order to use this program, you will need data files that correspond to how we implemented the program. For assignment
one, there needs to be a data file that has a user name and password that are separated by white space. It should be in
the format of ``user1 pass1 \\n user2 pass2'' where \\n is an actual new line. We have provided a sample file for your
convenience. Once you load up the program, it asks you to enter a file name with the user info in it. It will do this
until you have correctly entered in a file name that is readable and in the correct format. Once this happens, you are
brought to a menu in which you can do the operations that are required. It should be fairly simple from here.

To use part 2 of the assignment, you will need to use a data file that has integers in it separated by white space. When
the program begins, it asks for a file name until it is given a suitable file name is given. Once inside the main menu,
you will have the options of what was assigned for this challenge. Once here, it should be fairly straight forward as to
what each menu item does.

\section{Bugs and Errors}

For the first section of the assignment there were no errors creating the binary tree, but there were however some
problems when I began trying to use the binary tree in the code.  The main problem was that the list of users we were
given was stored in order which caused some headaches when trying to create a binary tree because I was ending up with a
linked list rather than a tree.  The way I knew this was that the pre-order traversal was outputting the same values as
the in-order traversal.  To correct this issue I created a function that read the file into an array first and then;
using the property that any element in the array can be accessed in constant time; picked random elements in the array
and placed them into the tree which worked very nicely in fact.

Another rather silly issue I spent way too much time on was that I forgot that ostream is part of the std namespace. It
took nearly an hour of debugging to realize why I was receiving an entire page of cryptic compile errors.  After adding a
single line (using namespace std) to the beginning of the binaryTree.h file all those errors disappeared.

In part 2 of the assignment, the biggest bug that was found was that I could not figure out how to access the heaps
element pointer in the U\_PQType class. Even though the data members of pqueue were protected, the compiler would not
let me access them. This bug was avoided by using a different approach to the problem that worked just as well in the
end. 

Another problem that was encountered was the correct syntax for using a template class as a pointer and passing that
pointer by reference to a function. This was not so much an error, but more as an experience that helped me understand
the syntax more clearly. 

\section{What was Learned}

The main thing that was learned in this assignment was the implementation and use of different data structures. We were
exposed to the binary search tree implemented as a link list and a heap and priority queue implemented as a dynamic
array. This provided valuable experience to the students in the data structures involved and helped them understand what
makes a well designed data structure and when to use the appropriate data structure. 

The students also furthered their knowledge of templates and how to implement complex data structures as templates. This
knowledge will help them in the future because they will be equipped with the knowledge of how to implement complex data
structures using templates instead of rewriting data structures to handle every object type. The students are therefore
better equipped to overcome the challenges that they will meet in the real world and are better prospective employees as
a result of their knowledge and practical application of using the data structures involved in this programming
assignment.

\section{Division of Labor}

For this assignment, Josh did part 1 of the assignment. He wrote the binary tree implementation, the user class, and the
driver. The binary tree was implemented using a linked list approach to allow for it's ease of expandability. He also
worked on the documentation for those parts and helped overall with the report and with its writing.

Josiah wrote part 2 of the assignment. This involved writing the pqueue implementation which relied on the heap
implementation that he also wrote. Josiah also wrote the U\_PQType class that was derived from the pqueue class. Josiah
implemented all of this using dynamic arrays so that the heap could be implemented efficiently. Josiah also worked on
the report for the assignment and wrote the documentation for the functions that he implemented. 

\section{Inner workings of Remove and Update}

The way the Remove function was implemented for the U\_PQType is that it actually dequeues the entire list and then
enqueues only the values that are not equal to the value being removed.  While we do realize this is definitely not the
most efficient method to accomplish this, we were rather pressed for time due to many end of the semester projects,
tests, and assignments.  The time complexity for this function is
$\mathcal{O}\Big(n*(log_2(n)+log_2(n)\Big)=\mathcal{O}\Big(n*log_2(n)\Big)$ to dequeue the entire list then the same to
enqueue it again. This makes the entire function a total of...

$\mathcal{O}\Big(n*log_2(n)\Big)$

The method used for the Update function nearly identical to that of Remove where we simply dequeued the entire list and
enqueued everything back onto it.  The only difference is that when dequeueing the list, when we came across the desired
item to be updated we changed it's value.  The efficiency is therefore the exact same being...

$\mathcal{O}\Big(n*log_2(n)\Big)$
